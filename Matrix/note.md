There are different types of matrcies.all matrices in this section are squared matrices.
Diagnol matrix , only diagnol elements are non - zero.
LowerTraingular Matrix - only lower triangular are non-zero.
UpperTraingualar Matrix - only the upper triangular are non-zero
Symmetric Matrix - M[i][j] = M[j][i].
Toeplitz Matrix - elements in a diagnal are equal , M[i][j] = M[i-1][j-1].
Tridiagnal Matrix - upper,main,lower diagnal elements are non-zero. Upper: i-j = -1, Main: i-j =0,Lower: i-j =1.
SquareBand Matrix - similar to tridiagnal matrix, difference is there will more than one upper and lower diagnals, where number of upper = number of lower.
